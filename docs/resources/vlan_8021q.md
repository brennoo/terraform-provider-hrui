# hrui_vlan_8021q (Resource)

Configures 802.1Q VLAN settings.

## Introduction

IEEE 802.1Q, often referred to as Dot1q, is the networking standard that supports virtual local area networking (VLANs) on an IEEE 802.3 Ethernet network. 802.1Q VLANs allow you to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks, improving security and network organization. This resource enables you to create and manage VLANs, specifying the `vlan_id` (a unique identifier between 1 and 4094), a descriptive `name` for the VLAN, and the list of `untagged_ports` and `tagged_ports` that belong to the VLAN. Untagged ports carry traffic for only one VLAN, while tagged ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs using 802.1Q tagging. The resource also provides a read-only attribute, `member_ports`, which lists all ports associated with the VLAN, regardless of whether they are tagged or untagged.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hrui_vlan_8021q" "example" {

  vlan_id = 10
  name    = "vlan10"

  untagged_ports = ["Port 1", "Port 2"]
  tagged_ports   = ["Trunk1"]

}
```
