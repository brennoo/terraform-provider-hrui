# hrui_mac_limit (Resource)

Manages MAC address entry limits for specific ports.

## Introduction

Limiting the number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a port provides a security mechanism to prevent MAC address flooding attacks and helps control network access.  By enabling a MAC limit on a port, you restrict the number of devices that can connect to that port.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hrui_mac_limit" "example" {
  port    = "Port 1"
  enabled = true
  limit   = 2
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the MAC limit is enabled on this port.
- `port` (String) The name of the port to configure (e.g., 'Port 1', 'Trunk2').

### Optional

- `limit` (Number) The MAC limit value, between 0 and 4160. This is required when `enabled` is `true`.
