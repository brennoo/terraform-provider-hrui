Manages STP Port configuration



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `edge` (String) Edge port setting, used to designate whether the port connects to an end device ('True') or another switch ('False').
- `path_cost` (Number) The desired STP path cost for the port.
- `port` (Number) Port ID representing the physical switch port.
- `priority` (Number) The STP port priority, affecting the port's contribution to the spanning-tree root bridge decision.

### Read-Only

- `p2p` (String) Point-to-point (P2P) configuration:

- **Valid values:** 'Auto', 'True', 'False'.
- When set to 'Auto', the system automatically determines the P2P configuration based on the port's operation.
- **Note:** Due to a known limitation in firmware version 1.9, changes to this attribute do not take effect.
- `role` (String) Current role of the port in the STP topology (e.g., 'Designated', 'Root').
- `state` (String) Reflects the current spanning-tree protocol (STP) state of the port (e.g., 'Forwarding', 'Blocked').
