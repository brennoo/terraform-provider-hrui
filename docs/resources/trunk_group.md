# hrui_trunk_group (Resource)

Manages trunk group settings.

## Introduction

Trunk groups, also known as link aggregation groups (LAGs) or port channels, combine multiple physical ports into a single logical link, increasing bandwidth and providing link redundancy. This resource enables you to create and manage trunk groups, specifying the `id` of the group (`1` or `2`), the `type` of aggregation (either `static` or using the Link Aggregation Control Protocol `LACP`), and the list of `ports` that belong to the trunk group.  Using trunk groups can significantly improve network performance and resilience.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hrui_trunk_group" "example" {
  id    = 2
  type  = "LACP"
  ports = [4, 5, 6]
}
```
