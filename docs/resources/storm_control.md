# hrui_storm_control (Resource)

Manages storm control settings.

## Introduction

Storm control is a mechanism to limit the amount of broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic on a port, preventing excessive traffic from overwhelming the network. This helps protect the network from broadcast storms or other traffic floods. You must specify the `port` on which to enable storm control, the `storm_type` (`Broadcast`, `Known Multicast`, `Unknown Unicast`, or `Unknown Multicast`) that you wish to control, and the `state` (`enabled` or `disabled`). When `enabled`, you can also specify the `rate` in kbps, which defines the maximum allowed rate for the specified traffic type on the port.  Exceeding this rate will result in the excess traffic being dropped.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hrui_storm_control" "example" {
  port       = "Port 1"
  storm_type = "Broadcast"
  state      = true
  rate       = 100000
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `port` (String) The port name to enable storm control on. Changing this will recreate the resource.
- `state` (Boolean) Whether storm control is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`).
- `storm_type` (String) The type of traffic to control. Options: Broadcast, Known Multicast, Unknown Unicast, Unknown Multicast.

### Optional

- `rate` (Number) The maximum rate (in kbps) for storm control traffic. Valid values are greater than 0 and less than the maximum rate.
