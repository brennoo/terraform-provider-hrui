# hrui_qos_port_queue (Resource)

Configures QoS port queue settings.

## Introduction

QoS allows you to prioritize different types of network traffic, ensuring that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency. This resource focuses on configuring the QoS settings for a specific queue on a given port. You must specify the `port` and the `queue` number you wish to configure.  Different queues can be assigned different priorities and bandwidth allocations, allowing you to fine-tune network performance based on your specific needs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "hrui_qos_port_queue" "example" {
  port  = "Port 1"
  queue = 2
}
```
